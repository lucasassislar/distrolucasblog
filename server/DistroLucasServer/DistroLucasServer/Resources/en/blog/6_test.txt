!IGNORE
I just want to try and be free and create what I can to change the world.

ps.: Wouldn't it be funny if I died tomorrow? I'm comfortable with that but lol that would be some timing
ps.2.: By the way before anyone says anything, I've seen like 20 different psychiatrists (been with the same for 4 years so that's kinda good), I have bipolar disorder (manic depression) and was medicated for that.
I've taken 15+ different meds, from anti-depressives to mood-stabilizer and anti-psichotics, but to be honest I've never felt more dead than under the influence of these substances. I've learned from them, and being on one or the other for the past 10 years has taught me A LOT. But to be honest, I'm at the point that if I take anything else I'm killing myself, and I don't want to see my potential wasted.
ps.3.: This is my blog! Welcome =) I'm going to keep writing about what interests me or any kind of self-evaluation I can find. I hope this is useful to someone at some time in their lives.

Fear of admitting their short comings. This constant creation of 'clubs' that create a sense of inner pride instead of self-reevaluation. We'd rather jerk each other off than admit that we're all flawed - that all your opinions can be wrong.
Why don't you free yourself from the fear that you can be completely wrong?
The desperation to feel unique from everybody else, while finding half-thought ways is not only insane, it's benefitless. It advances nothing. It's a waste of human resources (wow robot view). Our sons will live a great life. We're getting fucked and we'll be happy about that, I can't be comfortable now.
Even though 60% of the pollution comes from like 7 companies, we still have a horse in this race. It's like finding arguments to actually eat meat from dead animals - how do you even being to explain the moral dilemma of killing something in a year where it's easily acessible to eat less meat? So I just need to know I'm shameless everytime I do, and hope I can slowly change.
 (tive que refutar meu tio chamando funkeiro de preto que ouve musica alta, tentando explorar que ele odeia o desrespeito desse funkeiro especifico nao o estereotipo - mas n foi pra lugar nenhum)

It's 2 sides of the same coin:
"With great power, comes great responsibility"
and
"Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm"
