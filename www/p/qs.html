                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Dan wakes up early morning with bags under his eyes.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Life seems to fade by. He can vaguely remember getting on the
                                bus, but it&rsquo;s not more than a shallow memory; almost like he teleported to the
                                coffee shop.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A fellow worker asks in an uplifting manner how he&rsquo;s doing.
                                A bit startled, Dan answers:</span></p>

                            <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, just didn&rsquo;t had much to
                                    sleep last night.&#39;&#39;</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In a mind numbing cycle of coffee after coffee, he isn&rsquo;t
                                even thinking anymore. Just wants to finish his job to return home.</span></p>
                        <ul class="c7 lst-kix_ropmro6mtz3q-0 start">
                            <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;See you Dan, till tomorrow&rdquo;</span></li>

                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">He couldn&rsquo;t answer without slightly grinning, as he knew
                                there wouldn&rsquo;t be a tomorrow.</span></p>
                        <ul class="c7 lst-kix_z2h217i9tops-0 start">
                            <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;See you Ann, till another day&rdquo;</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Back home, all doubt seemed to fade. For once, the hole he felt
                                inside of him was filled.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">He puts the gun in his mouth.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The revolver clicks, and for an instant (or at least for him it
                                felt like an instant), Dan watched himself from outside his own head. He saw his mom
                                finding his body. The sounds coming out of her no son should hear.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">He felt someone (or rather something) holding his hand and
                                dragging him to his funeral, following in a flash the lives of everyone he touched,
                                ending with the last time his name was whispered.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The gun somehow failed. Nothing he saw had come. Had he dreamt
                                all that? </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Trying desperately to make sense of what had just happened, he
                                could only stop and cry. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Was he given another chance? Did all of that really
                                happen?</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">At that point things weren&rsquo;t much better for him. If
                                anything, the depression was even worse; knowing that his sudden death would affect
                                people he wasn&rsquo;t even close with. Only then had he understood how selfish it was
                                of him to give up.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">As life is, it goes on. Same old, same old, day by day seems to
                                fade away.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A random thursday, no more than 2 weeks after the incident, his
                                shift had ended. Walking through the city, anxious to get back home, he spots a young
                                woman walking in the middle of the street - oblivious to the cars passing by.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">He sees a bus about to make a right turn into her street.
                                She&rsquo;s in his blind spot. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Without much thought or care, he rushes to the street to push her
                                - only to be hit himself by the bus. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">A quick flash, and he was again outside his body. Everything
                                seemed to pass through his eyes so quickly, ending with the last time his name was said.
                                The hand brought him back home.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Suddenly, he wakes back at his bathroom - with a gun in his hand.
                            </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Completely lost and without direction, he panicked. <br>Without
                                knowing exactly how was he alive, he could only stop and wonder while completely static
                                - his face in the mirror, the same as supposedly 2 weeks ago.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Getting out of this stasis state, he went to check his phone. It
                                was indeed the day he had attempted; or rather, successfully, killed himself.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2"><br>The only thing left to do was wait. Wait until the day that
                                silly girl walked on the wrong side of the street.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">And wait he did. The days seemed somewhat more interesting, now
                                that he was reliving them. Finding new ways to fuck with people instantly became his
                                hobby; he didn&rsquo;t quite remember as much as he wanted to, but barely enough to toy
                                with everyone.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The day had come. He remembered the time it happened perfectly,
                                and made sure to be in the same place at the same time, but, this time, no girl.
                                Confused, he started looking around trying to find her, only to see her sitting in a
                                bench waiting for the same bus. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Somehow, she wasn&rsquo;t in danger. Something was different, but
                                he couldn&rsquo;t grasp what.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Without much more to do or say - heck, what would he say to the
                                girl? I died to save you? He&rsquo;d look insane - he got in a bus going home. Not very
                                far into the way, 2 suspicious looking guys entered the bus. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
                                robbery! Everyone purses out, give me your phones&rdquo;. Both armed going through the
                                corridor, when an old man decided not to comply with their call.</span></p>
                        <ul class="c7 lst-kix_sd6wvhpkn7dv-0 start">
                            <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c2">&ldquo;Old fella just give it or I&rsquo;ll blow a hole
                                    in your head&rdquo;</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The old man didn&rsquo;t budge. The men rapidly got annoyed and
                                started beating the old chap.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Dan didn&rsquo;t want to interfere, but more than ever he
                                wasn&rsquo;t afraid of death. He could throw himself at both men, and if his past is any
                                indication he would just wake up in his bathroom again. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Without much thinking he jumped them. He was quickly shot in the
                                chest, but managed to grab a gun from one of the aggressors. He shot one in the head,
                                who died immediately, while the other managed to run. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Dan was hemorrhaging, and rapidly fell to the ground. In his last
                                moments he tried to console everyone &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alright; I did what had to be
                                done, don&rsquo;t worry&rdquo;. He wasn&rsquo;t sure he had done the right thing; and
                                for a moment he wasn&rsquo;t even sure he would actually come back. Maybe he was just a
                                bit insane, and now he had actually gotten himself killed.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">As he laid there dying, he saw a figure by his side. It&rsquo;s
                                form almost inexplicable; it looked almost as if it sucked light into itself - probably
                                how a black hole looks from up close.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">It took his hand and led him on. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Almost conscious of himself, Dan tried asking the being for what
                                was happening to him. The entity spoke thus:</span></p>
                        <ul class="c7 lst-kix_92aog11n0pdm-0 start">
                            <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m ashamed I did it but it had to be done. More
                                    than ever I needed the help.</span></li>
                            <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c2">Did what? How exactly am I helping?</span></li>
                            <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c2">I can&rsquo;t say much or I risk ruining it all.
                                    You&rsquo;ll have to solve this riddle with time. One day I hope we can talk openly,
                                    but not today.</span></li>
                            <li class="c1 c3"><span class="c2">...What?</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In a blink of his past life he was back in his bathroom, gun in
                                his hand. A little bit scared, but this time with an almost somber mood he was ready to
                                do things again.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">He wasn&rsquo;t sure of much, but knew with an uncertain
                                certainty that somewhere in his future someone would be close to death, and the only way
                                to save them would be to give his life in exchange.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Reliving days he had already relived added a certain mellowness
                                to the air. Not knowing when his sacrifice was needed made every interaction a bit
                                mind-numbing.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Quickly he realized that if his help was needed, he probably
                                couldn&rsquo;t die by random accidents. Walking in the streets late at night became
                                somewhat of a delight to him, talking to the city - his only friend at this point.
                            </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In one of these walks, he saw a woman being followed. He knew his
                                time had come once again. A million thoughts raced through his mind, mostly &ldquo;I
                                only walk through these streets cause I can&rsquo;t be killed, somehow that deity knew
                                that? Was I bound to walk these streets to find her?&rdquo;</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">This time he didn&rsquo;t have second thoughts; he saw the guy
                                attempting to rape the girl. He jumped him, and the girl managed to run. But the man was
                                having none of that, with a knife in his hand he slit Dan&rsquo;s throat from ear to
                                ear. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">With the figure once again by his side, Dan laid there dying. The
                                man escaped, but that was probably not his time, Dan thought as his brain was quickly
                                shutting down. He was quickly led to see what had come out of his life, finishing with
                                the last time his name was whispered.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Back at the bathroom. No sadness, no crying; only a bit of joy on
                                having made a difference.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">More sure than ever of his now purpose, he decided to embrace it.
                            </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Walking through those streets he knew he would be wherever he was
                                needed, so he decided to travel the world. Sold all his belongings and bought a plane
                                ticket to a random country. He knew his destiny was wherever the world took him.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Millions; hell billions, uncountable people had he saved. Never
                                more than 3 months away from the incident. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">His frail human mind couldn&rsquo;t remember much from all these
                                past lives - at this point he had lived for millennia at the same point in time - but
                                that one interaction with the deity being was stuck in his head.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">He knew he was being used. If anything, to him he was an Agent of
                                Life, saving people through what he thought were parallel universes; to what purpose he
                                wasn&rsquo;t sure.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">He was only really sure of one thing - he wasn&rsquo;t free.
                                Somehow, he would always end up where he was needed. His life was perfectly
                                deterministic. Free-will more than ever became an illusion, something his mind accepted
                                to not drive himself insane.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Still, all the sacrifices took a toll on him. At this point he
                                knew there was no amount of knowledge that could save him, the outcome of all encounters
                                would be his death. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Reset, to live in the same span of time. Disconnected from the
                                world he was trying to save.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Seeing his family mourn his death an uncountable amount of times;
                                seeing the suffering that he was powerless to fix.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Knowing that whatever love he found was bound to end.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Either way, he kept faithfully doing it, until something changed.
                                At this point, it had been 6 months since the incident. In all the loops, it had never
                                been more than 3. Something had definitely changed.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">He wasn&rsquo;t sure but something indeed felt different. For the
                                first time in forever he felt free. The universe wasn&rsquo;t bounding him. </span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">Once again he felt something he had only felt in his teenage
                                years. He had his entire life ahead of him. He could love and be loved. He could pass
                                the time with the people he knew without being afraid.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">The chemistry of his brain still wasn&rsquo;t quite right, but he
                                could only be hopeful for the future.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">And so he went on with his life. He fell in love, and for a
                                moment, if brief but powerful, he understood what it meant to be human. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">By having children, he was again afraid for his own
                                existence.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">He was very careful to not mention of his past to no one. After
                                all, no one would surely believe that such an insane thing had happened. That was his
                                last personal sacrifice.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">In his late 60s, he was still thinking daily about his past
                                lives. Not that it mattered much at this point, but it was something he held on to. Very
                                aware of the sacrifice he had made, and more than ever happy that he was able to do
                                something with his life. Every waking moment a blessing.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>
                        <p class="c1"><span class="c2">When finally his heart beat its last. He fell to the ground by
                                his lover, not sad; but glad that his moment had finally came. The being was once again
                                there, to take him by the hand.</span></p>
                        <p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p>

                                am.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1 c9 c4"><span class="c2">Time is an illusion that as much as it emanates from me, I

                                many universes you&rsquo;ve passed through.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1 c4 c9"><span class="c2">I did what I had to do because as much as humans love to
                                say I&rsquo;m all powerful, I have no control over the physical world. It&rsquo;s insane
                                to have to watch over all, and being essentially powerless to stop the insanity
                                that&rsquo;s currently happening.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1 c9 c4"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s where you come in, my dear. </span></p>
                        <p class="c1 c9 c4"><span class="c2">Each individual person you saved is essential to the fate
                                of that universe. Him or her dying would change entirely the outcome of this precisely
                                crafted machine.</span></p>
                        <p class="c1 c4"><span class="c2">That&rsquo;s the price of free-will. Humans are inherently
                                deterministic, but for reasons not even I clearly understand you can never predict the
                                result of their actions. You can add 3 humans to a room and suddenly you can&rsquo;t
                                ever predict what the hell the outcome is in 15 years.</span></p>
