# DistroLucas.com
PERSONAL RULES:
- Nothing on the site should use non-personal source code
- Optimization is the highest priority
- Maybe? Make this be backwards-compatible (IE6)

TO-DO:
- GZip support

SO FAR:
- JSON takes more space than just lines of text
- PNG can actually be lighter than JPEGs on specific cases

This is my personal safe haven for re-inventing the wheel.
