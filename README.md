# DistroLucas.com
PERSONAL RULES:
- Nothing on the site should use non-personal source code
- Optimization is the highest priority
- Maybe? Make this be backwards-compatible (IE6)

This is my personal safe haven for re-inventing the wheel.

TOOLS USED:
- Visual Studio Code
- HTTPS by Certbot
- Reverse Proxy/HTTPS handling by NGinx
- Dynamic JS by NucleusJS: https://github.com/lucasassislar/nucleusjs
- Server by Nucleus.Gaming: https://github.com/lucasassislar/nucleusgaming
    - Initial HTTP server code by David Jeske
    - Additional attributes for Route Management and listing more akin to ASP.NET/Express
	- Mono on Ubuntu
