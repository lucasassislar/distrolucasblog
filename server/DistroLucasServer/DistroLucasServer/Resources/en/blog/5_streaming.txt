Live-Streaming and Its Quirks
All platforms are kinda weird
February 4th, 2019
<b>YouTube</b>
<i>Pros: </i>
If you can Stream on YouTube, it'll allow anyone to watch in any resolution (so people with bad internet can watch my stream even if I do it in 4k 25mbits).
<i>Cons: </i>
<ul>
    <li>You can only stream on YouTube if you have more than 1000 subscribers (so in a way, just like Twitch).</li>
    <li>If your stream is playing copyrighted music, YouTube will straight up DROP your stream (basically corporations control this ecosystem, it's really bad).</li>
</ul>

<i>Quirks: </i>
YouTube's 1080p is shite. It limits the bandwidth allowed for the stream, and even though I might stream on a way higher bitrate YouTube just crunches everything.
The solution to make YouTube look crisp is upscaling my 1080p content to 4k, as 4k is allowed a waaaaay higher bandwidth (so even though the resolution is theoretically the same, watching my YouTube stream in 4k is insanely better).

<b>Twitch</b>
<i>Pros:</i> 
<ul>
    <li>Twitch lets you play all the copyrighted songs you want, but it will block the VODs later (not live).</li>
    <li>Twitch's community tools are really great to interact with everyone that's watching (the entire emoji culture is awesome)</li>
</ul>
<i>Cons:</i> 
It only converts your Stream to different qualities IF you're a partned streamer. Becoming a partnered Twitch streamer doesn't seem easy at all.

<b>Mixer</b>
I haven't tested it yet, and I'm quite curious to do so. Maybe next stream :)

Just some thoughts, as we go forward I'll be updating.
