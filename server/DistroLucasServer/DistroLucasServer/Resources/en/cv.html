<h2>2008</h2>
<h3>Unnamed (My first game ever)</h3>
<h5>Tech: J2ME/3D</h4>
This was a project I was developing to learn how to develop 3D games in Java/J2ME. At this time I was 12.

I didn't even have a mobile phone at that time, I tested it on my grandpa's N73.
I couldn't for the life of me code the game to return to the menu, so when you hit a block the game just crashes (it ain't broke if it works lol).
Also it only ended up being 3D as I couldn't for the life of me understand how to develop sprite-tiled games in J2ME.

<h2>2009</h2>
<h3>Dream Build Play contest</h3>
<h5>Tech: XNA/JigLibX</h4>

Brazilians weren't *technically* allowed to publish on Xbox Live Indie Games, but I found a loophole.
An XBLIG account costed $95 (that was around R$350 at that time), and being a 14 year old I was piss poor.
Participating in Dream Build Play awarded me an XBLIG subscription for 6 months, so I could release the next game.

<h3>Falling Down</h3>
<h4>Xbox Live Indie Games</h4>
<h5>Tech: XNA/JigLibX/Xbox 360</h4>
Falling Down was the first ever brazilian Xbox Live Indie Game. It was developed by me, with music from Thiago Adamo.

I didn't have an american bank account, so I never received anything from the sale of this game.
More than anything, releasing this game was one of my happiest achievements. Getting praised by Microsoft MVPs certainly put me on the right way.

The menu was made in 3D, as I did not know how to code a menu that would work inside my own game engine.
The letters were all 3D modelled (no text to mesh tool here), some characters look reallllly bad.

<h2>2012</h2>
<h3>Futuron</h3>
<h4>Tech: XNA/Windows Phone 7, later MonoGame</h4>
This project was developed by me, Persio Flexa and Edson Lima.
I was responsible for the game engine and mostly the rendering system.

My biggest achievement in this project is a on-demand LOD loading system, where we had a custom model format that could load meshes in chunks.
As this was a mobile game running on 256MB of RAM WP7 devices, it not only would take forever to open the game if we loaded everything, there wouldn't be enough RAM.
Rendering system was based on an octree structure, so I could quickly raycast and not draw objects that are not in view - with that we actually got a stable 30 FPS on pretty much all WP7 devices.

<h2>2015-2018</h2>
<h3>Pixel Ripped 1989</h3>
<h4>Tech: Unity/PS VR/Oculus</h4>
I was insanely lucky to participate in this project. I actually met Ana (the project's creator/idealizer) when I went to E3 2015.
Fun story: I had a kidney stone when I went there, and actually passed 1 day in the hospital in Los Angeles. I had gone alone, and a worried friend told me to go and meet Ana, as she was another brazilian that was in the event. It's insane how many things had to go exactly right for me to end up meeting her.

My responsibilities in this project involved mostly optimization and implementation of features/easing the creation of levels.
